# Atlassian JWT Authentication

Atlassian JWT Authentication provides support for handling JWT authentication as required by
 Atlassian when building add-ons: https://developer.atlassian.com/static/connect/docs/latest/concepts/authentication.html

## Installation

### From Git

You can check out the latest source from git:

`git clone https://github.com/MeisterLabs/atlassian-jwt-authentication.git`

Or, if you're using Bundler, just add the following to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'atlassian-jwt-authentication', 
  git: 'https://github.com/MeisterLabs/atlassian-jwt-authentication.git'
```

## Usage

### Setup

This gem relies on the `jwt_tokens` table being present in your database and 
the associated JwtToken model.

To create those simply use the provided generators:

```
bundle exec rails g atlassian_jwt_authentication:setup
```

If you are using another database for the JWT data storage than the default one, pass the name of the DB config to the generator:
```
bundle exec rails g atlassian_jwt_authentication:setup shared
```

Don't forget to run your migrations now!

### Controller filters

The gem provides 2 endpoints for an Atlassian add-on lifecycle, installed and uninstalled. 
For more information on the available Atlassian lifecycle callbacks visit 
https://developer.atlassian.com/static/connect/docs/latest/modules/lifecycle.html.

If your add-on baseUrl is not your application root URL then include the following 
configuration for the context path. This is needed in the query hash string validation 
step of verifying the JWT:
```ruby
# In the add-on descriptor:
# "baseUrl": "https://www.example.com/atlassian/confluence",

AtlassianJwtAuthentication.context_path = '/atlassian/confluence'
```

#### Add-on installation
The gem will take care of setting up the necessary JWT tokens upon add-on installation and to
delete the appropriate tokens upon un-installation. To use this functionality, simply call
 
```ruby
include AtlassianJwtAuthentication

before_action :on_add_on_installed, only: [:installed]
before_action :on_add_on_uninstalled, only: [:uninstalled]
```

#### Add-on authentication
Furthermore, protect the methods that will be JWT aware by using the gem's
JWT token verification filter. You need to pass your add-on descriptor so that
the appropriate JWT shared secret can be identified:

```ruby
include AtlassianJwtAuthentication

# will respond with head(:unauthorized) if verification fails
before_filter only: [:display, :editor] do |controller|
  controller.send(:verify_jwt, 'your-add-on-key')
end
```

Methods that are protected by the `verify_jwt` filter also give access to information
about the current JWT token instance and logged in account (when available):

* `current_jwt_token` returns `JwtToken`
* `current_account_id` returns `String`

Furthermore, this information is stored in the session so you will have access
to these 2 instances also on subsequent requests even if they are not JWT signed.

```ruby
# current_jwt_token returns an instance of JwtToken, so you have access to the fields described above
pp current_jwt_token.addon_key
pp current_jwt_token.base_url
```

If you need detailed user information you need to obtain it from the instance and process it respecting GDPR.

#### Add-on licensing
If your add-on has a licensing model you can use the `ensure_license` filter to check for a valid license.
As with the `verify_jwt` filter, this simply responds with an unauthorized header if there is no valid license
for the installation.

```ruby
before_filter :ensure_license
```
If your add-on was for free and you're just adding licensing now, you can specify
the version at which you started charging, ie. the minimum version of the add-on
for which you require a valid license. Simply include the code below with your version
string in the controller that includes the other add-on code.
```ruby
def min_licensing_version
  Gem::Version.new('1.0.0')
end
```

### Middleware

You can use a middleware to verify JWT tokens (for example in Rails `application.rb`):

```ruby
config.middleware.insert_after ActionDispatch::Session::CookieStore, AtlassianJwtAuthentication::Middleware::VerifyJwtToken, 'your_addon_key'
```

Token will be taken from params or `Authorization` header, if it's verified successfully request will have following headers set:

* atlassian_jwt_authorization.jwt_token `JwtToken` instance
* atlassian_jwt_authorization.account_id `String` instance
* atlassian_jwt_authorization.context `Hash` instance

Middleware will not block requests with invalid or missing JWT tokens, you need to use another layer for that.

### Making a service call

Build the URL required to make a service call with the `rest_api_url` helper or
make a service call with the `rest_api_call` helper that will handle the request for you.
Both require the method and the endpoint that you need to access:

```ruby
# Get available project types
url = rest_api_url(:get, '/rest/api/2/project/type')
response = Faraday.get(url)

# Create an issue
data = {
    fields: {
        project: {
            'id': 10100
        },
        summary: 'This is an issue summary',
        issuetype: {
            id: 10200
        }
    }
}

response = rest_api_call(:post, '/rest/api/2/issue', data)
pp response.success?

```

### User impersonification

To make requests on user's behalf add `act_as_user` in scopes required by your app. 

Later you can obtain [OAuth bearer token](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/software/oauth-2-jwt-bearer-token-authorization-grant-type/) from Atlassian.

Do that using `AtlassianJwtAuthentication::UserBearerToken.user_bearer_token(account_id, scopes)`

### Logging

If you want to debug the JWT verification define a logger in the controller where you're including `AtlassianJwtAuthentication`:

```ruby
def logger
  Logger.new("#{Rails.root}/log/atlassian_jwt.log")
end
``` 

### Custom error handling

If you want to render your own pages when the add-on throws one of the following errors:
- forbidden
- unauthorized
- payment_required

overwrite the following methods in your controller:

```ruby
def render_forbidden
  # do your own handling there
  # render your own template 
  render(template: '...', layout: '...')
end

# the same for render_payment_required and render_unauthorized

```

## Installing the add-on

You can use rake tasks to simplify plugin installation:

```ruby
bin/rails atlassian:install[prefix,email,api_token,https://external.address.to/descriptor]
```

Where `prefix` is your instance name before `.atlassian.net`. You an get an [API token](https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloud/api-tokens-938839638.html) from [Manage your account](https://id.atlassian.com/manage/api-tokens) page.

## Configuration

Config | Environment variable | Description | Default |
------ | -------------------- | ----------- | ------- |
`AtlassianJwtAuthentication.context_path` | none | server path your app is running at | `''` 
`AtlassianJwtAuthentication.verify_jwt_expiration` | `JWT_VERIFY_EXPIRATION` | when `false` allow expired tokens, speeds up development, especially combined with webpack hot module reloading | `true` 
`AtlassianJwtAuthentication.log_requests` | `AJA_LOG_REQUESTS` | when `true` outgoing HTTP requests will be logged | `false` 
`AtlassianJwtAuthentication.debug_requests` | `AJA_DEBUG_REQUESTS` | when `true` HTTP requests will include body content, implicitly turns on `log_requests` | `false` 

## Requirements

Ruby 2.0+, ActiveRecord 4.1+

## Integrations

### Message Bus

With middleware enabled you can use following configuration to limit access to message bus per user / instance:
```ruby
MessageBus.user_id_lookup do |env|
  env.try(:[], 'atlassian_jwt_authentication.account_id')
end

MessageBus.site_id_lookup do |env|
  env.try(:[], 'atlassian_jwt_authentication.jwt_token').try(:id)
end
```

Then use `MessageBus.publish('/test', 'message', site_id: X, user_ids: [Y])` to publish message only for a user.

Requires message_bus patch available at https://github.com/HeroCoders/message_bus/commit/cd7c752fe85a17f7e54aa950a94d7c6378a55ed1


## Upgrade guide

### Version 0.7.x

Removed `current_jwt_user`, `JwtUser`, update your code to use `current_account_id`

### Versions < 0.6.x

`current_jwt_auth` has been renamed to `current_jwt_token` to match model name. Either mass rename or add `alias` in your controller:

```ruby
alias_method :current_jwt_auth, :current_jwt_token
helper_method :current_jwt_auth
```
